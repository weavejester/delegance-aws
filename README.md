# Delegance for AWS

This library allows [Delegance][1] to work with Amazon's [SQS][2] and
[SimpleDB][3] services.

[1]: https://github.com/weavejester/delegance
[2]: http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/
[3]: http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [delegance/amazon-web-services "0.1.0"]

## Usage

Create a configuration map using `simpledb-store` and `sqs-queue`:

```clojure
(def cred
  {:access-key ...
   :secret-key ...})

(def config
  {:queue (sqs-queue (assoc cred :queue "delegance"))
   :store (simpledb-store (assoc cred :domain "delegance"))})
```

Create the SQS queue and SimpleDB domain if necessary, then use the
config with delegance:

```clojure
(def worker
  (run-worker config))

(def result
  (delegate config `(+ 1 1))
```
